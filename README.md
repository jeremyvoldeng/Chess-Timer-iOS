# Chess-Timer-iOS
## A Chess Timing App For the Modern Era

Here at ChessBoys Inc, we pride ourselves on ingenuity and integrity. That is why we have designed a intuitive, easy-to-use 
chess timing app for the next generation.

## No More Restrictions.

On of our main features is to functionality to have a timer displayed on two devices at the same time. This removes 
the annoyance of having to use your non dominant hand to reach for the chess timer, and makes it much easier to simple enjoy the game.

When two devices load the app and are near each other, one player can choose the prefered settings and select "Pair with nearby device" 
and a connection will immediately be established between the two devices.

## A New World, Built for you.

A big part of our app is the endless customization available for games. Pick from different game modes, dynamic board setups, and 
fully interchangeable timer settings. 

## A New Kind of Timer.

With advancements in timers seemingly coming to a halt in the 19th century, we researched intensively to redefine what a timer truly is.
Designed from the ground up, our timer will blow you brains is so good. Literally head melting.
